Android Studio
==============

We've been using [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html#Updating) for development of the android app

Once downloaded and installed, go to "Configure" -> "SDK Manager" and install "Android 4.0.3 (API 15)" as well as the recommended updates.

Import a project, and point it to /owf-7-x/native-apps/android, and select
[x] Use auto-import
(x) Use default gradle wrapper (not configured for the current project) 
Then you should be all set!

Android Development Kit
=======================

Android Development Kit and SDK should be downloaded.

The SDK Android Development Kit is available from [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#download)

# Click on "Using an existing IDE" and download the SDK tools for Mac

# After you download the SDK tools, instructions will be provided for [Setting Up an Existing IDE](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html)

# Follow the instructions, which will lead you to [installing the eclipse plugin](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html)

# Again, follow these instructions, which will have you restart Eclipse once you've downloaded and installed the ADT plugin and have you configure the ADT plugin

# If you've already opened a project in eclipse, the Android SDK Manager is the 5th button over from the right (hover to see details)

# Most of the defaults should be fine (I think), but you'll want to install Android 4.0.3 (API 15) which is our (initial) target API for this project.

# Per the instructions, install the ADT Translation Manager Plugin.

# Open a new project: File -> New -> Project -> Android -> Android Project from Existing Code
## Specify the Root directory as /owf-7-x/native-apps/android/
